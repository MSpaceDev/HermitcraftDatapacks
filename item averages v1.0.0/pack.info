# Everything you should know about this pack:

UPDATE v1.0.0 [Base datapack]

1. The pack comes with a help function, once again
		- /trigger ia_help

2. The data point is green when its tracking, and red when it is not. All output goes to chat.

3. You can set the duration that a data point must be tracked. Longer track time = more accurate result

4. You must place a data point, and the start tracking. All items that flow through will be counted.

5. If items are stacked, the amount inside the stack will be accounted for.
	 e.g. System will add 3 items when a stack of 3 items passes by

6. The calculation is merely an estimate, and does not reflect the exact value. For example:
	 If your farm is performing well at the point of tracking, your average will be higher.
	 If your farm is performing badly at the point of tracking, your average will be lower
